## Introduction

This repository contains the configuration files (dotfiles) for my desktop workstation, based on Arch Linux. Other branches are used for my other devices. My system installation is documented [here](https://github.com/Vincevrp/cheat-sheets/blob/gh-pages/arch-install.pdf).

### Initialize

I use a bare git repository to manage my dotfiles. To initialize use the following commands:

```
git clone --bare <git-repo-url> $HOME/.dotfiles
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME'
dotfiles checkout
dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

If you receive an error message about untracked working tree files; run the following command:

```
mkdir -p dot-backup && \
dotfiles checkout 2>&1 | egrep "\s+\." | awk {'print $1'} | \
xargs -I{} mv {} .dot-backup/{}
```

The idea behind the method described here is based on [this](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) article.
